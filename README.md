Snyk is a SaaS tool that can be used to perform SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and SCA (Software Composition Analysis) on code bases. It can also scan Container images for vulnerabilities, and IaC security checks.

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scan is run to check vulnerabilities, license status, and outdated components in the open-source libraries and components of the source code. It is an important check to run regularly, to avoid audit issues, and legal liabilities.
